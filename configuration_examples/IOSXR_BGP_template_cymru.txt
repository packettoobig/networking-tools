! Team Cymru has removed all static bogon references from this template
! due to the high probability that the application of these bogon filters
! will be a one-time event. Unfortunately many of these templates are
! applied and never re-visited, despite our dire warnings that bogons do
! change.
!
! This doesn't mean bogon filtering can't be accomplished in an automated
! manner. Why not consider peering with our globally distributed bogon
! route-server project? Alternately you can obtain a current and well
! maintained bogon feed from our DNS and RADb services. Read more at the

! most reliable (in terms of stability) option.

soft-reconfiguration inbound
! Prevent a mistake or mishap by our peer (or someone with whom our peer
! has a peering agreement) from causing router meltdown by filling the
! routing and BGP tables. This is a hard limit. At 75% of this limit,
! the IOS XR will issue log messages warning that the neighbor is approaching
! the limit. All log messages should be sent to a remote syslog host.
! The warning water mark can be modified by placing a value after the
! maximum prefix value, e.g. maximum-prefix 250000 50. This will set the
! IOS XR to issue warning messages when the neighbor reaches 50% of
! the limit.
! Note that this number may need to be adjusted upward in the
! future to account for growth in the Internet routing table.
maximum-prefix 250000
! Announce only those networks we specifically list. This also prevents
