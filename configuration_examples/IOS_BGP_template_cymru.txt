! Announce our netblock(s) in a manner that does not increase CPU
! utilization. Redistributing from an IGP is dangerous as it increases
! the likelihood of flapping and instability. Redistributing static is
! more stable, but requires the CPU to peruse the routing table at a set
! interval to capture any changes. The network statement, combined with
! a null route, is the least expensive (in terms of CPU utilization) and
! most reliable (in terms of stability) option.

! Cisco provides a TTL security check feature. This is designed
! to limit the number of remote devices that can send BGP (TCP
! 179) packets to our router. Ideally this will lock down BGP
! access to the remote peering router only; it will certainly
! help, especially when coupled with other security techniques
! such as ACLs. Note that this isn't a 100% solution in a LAN
! (e.g. peering exchange) environment. It also must be adjusted
! so that the correct number of hops is set. Please verify the
! hop count using the 'trace' command before setting this option.
! You can read more about this feature here:

! Block any inbound announcments that include bogon networks. A prefix
! list is used because it is:
!  1) Easier on the CPU than ACLs, and
!  2) Easier to modify.
! See the actual bogons prefix-list below.

! Announce only those networks we specifically list. This also prevents
! the network from becoming a transit provider. An added bit of protection
! and good netizenship. See the announce prefix-list below.

!
! Prevent a mistake or mishap by our peer (or someone with whom our peer
! has a peering agreement) from causing router meltdown by filling the
! routing and BGP tables. This is a hard limit. At 75% of this limit,
! the IOS will issue log messages warning that the neighbor is approaching
! the limit. All log messages should be sent to a remote syslog host.
! The warning water mark can be modified by placing a value after the
! maximum prefix value, e.g. maximum-prefix 250000 50. This will set the
! IOS to issue warning messages when the neighbor reaches 50% of the limit.
! Note that this number may need to be adjusted upward in the future to
! account for growth in the Internet routing table.

! Team Cymru has removed all static bogon references from this template
! due to the high probability that the application of these bogon filters
! will be a one-time event. Unfortunately many of these templates are
! applied and never re-visited, despite our dire warnings that bogons do
! change.
!
! This doesn't mean bogon filtering can't be accomplished in an automated
! manner. Why not consider peering with our globally distributed bogon
! route-server project? Alternately you can obtain a current and well
! maintained bogon feed from our DNS and RADb services. Read more at the
